# Stretch Goal #1:


## Smart Goal #1:
As suggested in the meeting, I will have to replace the average block filter to true window pixels and expand my input features with {(top-left) (top-center) (top-right) (middle-left) (middle-center) (middle-right) (bottom-left) (bottom-center) (bottom-right)} for each of the satellite bands and the four model data

### S.Specific
I will incorporate the the three window sampling in the random forest and linear regression.

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook showcasing the feature importance with Satellite and Model Data

### A. Achievable
Due to the time I had spent researching random forest and training with small amouonts of datasets, makes me preapred to deal and interpret results from larger datasets as well.

### R. Relevent
it will us tell which neighborhood pixels are more prominent surrounding a pixel. This also will provide with a better understanding on which features are important in both satellit and in Model data. 

### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week. 

## Smart Goal #2:
I have to reinvent my workflow to now also include Model data as well namely: Relative Humidity, Specific Humidity, Temperature, and Visibility and also perform 1x1 and 3x3 window overlapping sampling.

### S.Specific
I will run the 1x1 Pixel's' to Pixel Random Forest Reregression on set of 93 images. This will provide with a better understanding about which features are important. 

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook showcasing the feature importance with Satellite and Model Data with 3x3 *overlapping* window

### A. Achievable
Due to the time I had spent researching random forest and training with small amouonts of datasets, makes me preapred to deal and interpret results from larger datasets as well.

### R. Relevent
This will provide with a better understanding on which features are important in both satellit and in Model data. 

### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week.

## Smart Goal #3:
Do the exact same thing did in Goals 1 and 2 now using Multiple Linear Regression. That is include overlapping of the pixels during inputting the dataset and include Model Data.

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook showcasing the feature importance with Satellite and Model Data with 3x3 *overlapping* window

### A. Achievable
Due to the time I had spent researching random forest and training with small amouonts of datasets, makes me preapred to deal and interpret results from larger datasets as well.

### R. Relevent
This will provide with a better understanding on which features are important in both satellit and in Model data. 

### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week.


## Goals achieved from last week
Goal #1:
ran the *1x1* Pixel's' to Pixel Random Forest Reregression on set of 93 set of images.  That is, each set consist of the 5 sattelite 256x256 images in the png format and their 1 radar 256x256 image also in png format.

Goal #2:
ran the *3x3* *5x5* *7x7* *9x9* Pixel's' to Pixel Random Forest Reregression on set of 93 set of images. That is, each set consist of the 4 sattelite 256x256 images in the png format and their 1 radar 256x256 image also in png format.

Goal #3:
ran the *1x1* *3x3* *5x5* *7x7* *9x9* Pixel's' to Pixel *Linear* Regression on set of 93 set of images. That is, each set consist of the 4 sattelite 256x256 images in the png format and their 1 radar 256x256 image also in png format.
