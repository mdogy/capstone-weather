# Stretch Goal 1:
One of the motivation to use Random Forest is the inbuilt method called: Feature Importance. It helps reveal the features that Random Forest uses the most if defining the decision tree. It is thus important to check if the model is stable, by finding the feature importance after fitting the model with a different dataset. 

# Smart Goal 1:
This week also I will focus on learning and using Random forest in scikit learn in python. 
Implement Random Forest for 1 row of data (1 set of 4 bands of satellite and 1 corresponding radar).

S.Specific
Implement, Run, and Test Random Forest for 1 row of data (1 set of 4 bands of satellite and 1 corresponding radar) before scaling to larger set of datas.
This week also I will focus on learning and using Random forest in scikit learn in python. 

M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook showcasing the seminal code that will be used for future notebooks.

A. Achievable
Yes, I have the resources like Siraj Raval's and Andrew Ng's Videos along with Scikit learn documentation to research and create the jupyter Notebook. 

R. Relevent
Because the project is on using Deep learning Algorithms, we need evidences that show Deep Learning models actually have advantages over the off-the shelf models.

T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week. 


# Smart Goal 2:
S.Specific
Implement, Run, and Test Random Forest for another 1 row of data (1 set of 4 bands of satellite and 1 corresponding radar) before scaling to larger set of datas.
