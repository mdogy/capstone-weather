# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Have to double check the tensorflow work since some outcomes have been weird so inputting the data again and then comparing to old

#### M. Measurable: 
Create a notebook comparing the new outcome 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of getting everything back since I have done it before just have to retrace the steps.

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project in having all the necessary components in order to be able to complete the project.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Get Visdom working with the new data and check the outputs for it  

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the outputs of the new runs

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since already have tensorboard working and now just have to do the same with pytorch


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it begins my purpose of being able to evaluate and compare different models done 


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Evaluate pytorch data using MSE and SSIM

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have the code that I use and the output graphs

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievable since I know how to do those errors metrics

#### R. Relevant :
Relevant to our project since need to start evaluating some models

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

Goals were mets since I got the new data of the new run using pytorch and Visdom. I attempted to get the graph of new data in Visdom but kept getting connection errors. Did demos on Visdom that worked so need to check  my connection. Went back to tensorflow to continue work on previous runs (have to double check the #s I got)
The work can be seen in:
