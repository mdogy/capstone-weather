# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 11/22/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have craete the linear regression model inputting 1 pixel at a time now to use a a baseline


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
While checking the different thresholds saw some interesting results. Get the images and show the different threshold for it.

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have a chart comparing the images with the different thresholds

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the skills to do this 

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project and creates a new "discovery" for linear regression


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Get the correctness of the different thresholds and create a line plot comparing with Samis pytorch implementation

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output graph

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since I have been dong the work for different runs


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because its comparing the two models and evaluating which one is better


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Have a clear understanding of the result on the threshold in order to talk about it clearly


#### M. Measurable: 
Will potentially have a markdown file for it

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since its understanding the work from the previous two goals

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives a better understanding of the linear regression
#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
All Goals were met this week since I created a more clear confusion matrix and got it for the old and new runs. In addition I got the coefficients and created a graph showing the importance of them. Furthermore tested different thresholds for the evaluation.
