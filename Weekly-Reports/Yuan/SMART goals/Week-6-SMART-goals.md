## Week 6 SMART Goals

### SMART Goal 1
##### From last week I was able to make room for vid2vid datasets, and I was able to have them downloaded on to the node. However there is still a problem of "CUDA image not found on machine". So this week I will post an issue on vid2vid's issues page and follow up with anyone who seems to have the same problem and understand what is causing this issue

### SMART Goal 2
##### Another goal this week would be to re install vid2vid, FlowNet and the datasets so that I can make sure it wasn't a installation error on my part. This will ensure that the installation process is not a problem. I would have to remove all cache of vid2vid and start from the beginning. This goal can be measured by having a new setup for vid2vid on the machines.

### SMART Goal 3
##### The third goal of the week would be to read over all command outputs to makesure that there were no warnings in outputs. If there were warnings, I will try to eliminate them, so that there can be nothing wrong with the virtual enviroment I set up for vid2vid. Warning could be the cause of the errors, and they easily be solved with updates to different libraries and tools. 

### Stretch goal
##### The stretch goal would be to run vid2vid on our own data, so that we can compare results to pix2pix, and see if it's worth to invest more computing power on vid2vid. This will help our project, because vid2vid has a video discriminator which ensures the optical flow of the output data. This should be done before the end of the semester so we can conclude that vid2vid works with our data and if it's worth an investment.
