# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have all models evaluated in order to have a final conclusion


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
New individual runs have been made by sammi with augnmented data. Need to get all of them from the machine at ccny

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have to evaluate so if I dont get them cant evaluate

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the skills to do this since its retriving new runs

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since I need them for evaluation purposes


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Need to evaluate each new run with confusion matrix SSIM MSE for runaugs

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output evaluations for each new run and the jupyter notebook

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since I have been doing the work for different runs just need to adjust for new ones


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because its evaluating new models and giving us more comparison material


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
If yuan gets output for her vid2vid then I can evaluate it as well


#### M. Measurable: 
Will have the ouput evaluation for her model

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since its running the evaluation on her model

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives a better understanding of the linputs

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
All Goals were met this week since I was able to get more output images for my linear regression. In addition I did the evaluation for each single input in pix2pix.
