# Stretch Goal #1: 
A bug was found in the algorithm for sliding window versions. Additionally certain quantitative numbers do not match the performance of the PNG version. This begs better interface, and additional tests and visualization of the output images. This week the goals are focused on not just genearting the images with the new patches to solve the issues but also visualizing the generated images. 

## Goal #1:
### S. Specific
Re-train and Perform *Visualization* of Multiple Regression 1x1 using Satellite and Model Data 

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook with tested and trained evaluation results of NPY dataset.

### A. Achievable
I have already written code for incorrect version. I have to resolve the issues and add re-write the extra component to visualize th eimages

### R. Relevent
So far the evaluations are performed quantitatively. i.e. using RMSE, Confusion Matrix, and Histograms. Visualing the actaul generated images will tell us if the models are actually working. and more specifically, where and where not.
 
### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week. Everything is possible



### Goal #2:
### S. Specific
Re-train and Perform *Visualization* of Random Forest Regression 1x1 using Satellite only and using and using (Satellite and Model Data) 

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook with tested and trained evaluation results of NPY dataset.

### A. Achievable

### T. Time-bound:

### Goal #3:
### S. Specific
Re-train and Perform *Visualization* of Random Forest Regression 3x3 using Satellite and Model Data 

### M. Measurable
Completion of this Goal will result in a jupyter notebook with tested and trained evaluation results of NPY dataset.
