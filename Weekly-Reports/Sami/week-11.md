## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)  

Goal 1. train more models on different datasets and different parameters:  
done, uploaded some of the scripts i used to github, such as [this](https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/sam/run_pix2pix/r.sh) and [this](https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/sam/run_pix2pix/downloadzip.py) to get rex's data from google drive as he was having tech. difficulties.
I ended up training 2 models, and doing data augmentation for one of them which i talked about in my final paper.
those models' results can be found on the server under ~/scratch/augmented and ~/scratch/sparseless2
