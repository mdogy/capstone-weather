# Week 2 SMART goals

## SMART Goal 1
##### The first smart goal of this week would be to download tensorflow on to my computer, since I’ve never worked with it before. I can experiment with code locally, and then transfer the code to the node cluster so when it’s ready it can use the GPUs on the node. This helps our project because we can use a recurrent neural network on our data to get rainfall data from satellite images. This can be measured by being able to run code on my local laptop and uploaded code on to github.

## SMART Goal 2
##### The second SMART goal of this week is to train a simple RNN on a simple task of language modeling. It predicts the next work of a text given the history of the previous texts. This can be measured by uploaded code on to github that solves this problem. This will help to ensure that tensorflow is working properly on my computer so I can create a RNN model specific to our problem. 
## SMART Goal 3
##### The third smart goal of the week would be to start working on a RNN that would predict radar values for satellite values, and figure out how I can tackle our problem using a RNN. I want read up more about how a RNN can be used with image values, and start to develop some code towards a RNN specific to our problem. This SMART goal can be measured through code on github. 

## Stretch Goal
##### The stretch goal of this week remains the same as last week, once the model data is minimized, I could run the linear regression model on the node so that we can have that model as a base model.
