## Week 2 Report

### SMART goal 1
##### The first goal was to install tensorflow on to my personal laptop as I was able to run a simple RNN model from a jupyter notebook. The notebook and its results can be seen in the echo rnn notebook.

### SMART goal 2
##### The second goal was to train a simple RNN model. The simple RNN model was a echo rnn model, where the input was a random binary vector and the output was the "echo" of the input which was the input shifted over a certain size to the right. This can be see in my jupyter notebook called echo rnn.

### SMART goal 3
##### The third goal was to start on a model for our weather project. I starte a notebook for the project but could not get very far, mainly because I feel like I need to do more research and more reading.
