# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 10/9/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Realized Iâ€™m missing model information from the runs in order to create the pytorch graphs of the loss so need to get them again from previous places

#### M. Measurable: 
Create a notebook/ have images that show that I have everything set up and ready 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of getting everything back since I have done it before just have to retrace the steps.

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project in having all the necessary components in order to be able to complete the project.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
After getting the info I can graph them and compare the graphs with the different runs and communicate findings with Sammi and Satyam

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the outputs of the graphs showing the differences of the runs

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since already have tensorboard working and now just have to do the same with pytorch


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it begins my purpose of being able to evaluate and compare different models done 


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Update the gen_loss markdown file I created previous week with the new findings and any other repo file that needs updating

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measureable because the repo will have in it all the new info that I add.

#### A. Achievable: 
I do have the skills for this goal.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it organizes the work we are doing and maintains the repo in good shape for when people look at it. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

Goal 1 and 2 were achieved -Looked into the gen_loss functions of the pix2pix and create a markdown file detailing the understanding of the functions since Sami has told us to look into it during our meeting
Created markdown file with the insights I got of the gen_loss function
work is in https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/Airton/Evaluation/Gen_loss_Understanding.md
Added to the repo wiki pages work and links that we have done so far like the powerpoints so that it's easily accessible and organized for future references
Work can be seen in wiki pages have more info in them
