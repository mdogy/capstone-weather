## Week 3 SMART Goals

### SMART Goal 1
##### Write documentation on everything that I know about RNNs so far, and do more research on a RNN model. This will be reflected by having an jupyter notebook dedicated to RNNs so that if anyone else on the team can use this resource as well. 

### SMART Goal 2
##### The second smart goal of the week would be to source out a sample time frame with no stops in between so that I can train and test the model with. This will be a small time frame since I am training and testing on my personal laptop. This will be good to the project since I can quickly code the model and make sure it works and then moving it on to the big machines for more data. 


### SMART Goal 3
##### The third smart goal of the week would be to integrate tensorflow APIs including LSTMStateTuple, and BasicRNNCell etc. These APIs were not used in the simple echo RNN, so as I start to build the RNN I want to learn more about the APIs and utilize them in the model.

### Stretch Goal
##### The stretch goal remains the same as the previous weeks
