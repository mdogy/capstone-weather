## Week 10 SMART Goals

Last week I was able to get googel Colaboratory all set up and ready to run vid2vid against our data. 

### SMART Goal 1
##### The first goal this week would be to run the scripts to download the vid2vid sample datasets and the trained models. This goal is important because I need to ensure that vid2vid has a correct environment, so if the sample datasets are also running into the same error then I know that our data format is not the issue. 

### SMART Goal 2
##### The second goal of this week would be to run the training script against the sample street dataset and see if it will train correctly instead of outputting errors. This is important because the datasets are given by vid2vid and if they donâ€™t run correctly then something is wrong again with the set up.


### SMART Goal 3
##### The third goal of this week is similar to the second goal, which is to run a testing script against the sample data. This means I will use the downloaded model that is already trained to test on sample data. 

### Stretch goal
##### The stretch goal would be to run vid2vid on our own data, so that we can compare results to pix2pix, and see if it's worth to invest more computing power on vid2vid. This will help our project, because vid2vid has a video discriminator which ensures the optical flow of the output data. This should be done before the end of the semester so we can conclude that vid2vid works with our data and if it's worth an investment.
