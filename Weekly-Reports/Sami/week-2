# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Sami
**Date:** Sept 11

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Be able to run pix2pix on the server from start to finish, using many features (from both datasets) as channels.  


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.  
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have  
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Modify pix2pix code or re-implement it either in tensorflow or pytorch, because currently   
no more than 3 channels (features) can be fed as input.  
I'll be working on this on my own.  

#### M. Measurable: 
- new code will be committed to the repo (most likely in the form of scripts)  

#### A. Achievable:  
No, I haven't written DNNs using frameworks before.  
This is hard but should be achievable, and will have great impact on the project.   
It'll also give me a deeper understanding of GANs which should make tackling future problems easier.  

#### R. Relevant :
Yes. in fact the project as it's currently planned can't go further without this goal.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
It depends... This will probably take 2 weeks.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Make use of the 2nd GPU present on the server.   
Pix2pix is utilizing 1 out of 2 avaliable GPUs and is rather slow.  


#### M. Measurable: 
If successful, 2nd gpu should show up as being utilized when training GAN.  
Might add a before- after- comparison of the training time to the repo wiki.  

#### A. Achievable: 
This goes hand in hand with goal 1 in term of the skills required. But should require less work.
So yes, It's achievable.


#### R. Relevant :
Yes, as a machine learning project, the faster we can train our models the better.


#### T. Time-bound: 
1 week. but may take longer depending on how goal 1 goes. 


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.


#### S. Specific: 
Re-run last week's training but this time, I'll be using modified Radar data.  
It appears, the radar data we've been using is not converted to images correctly (accordin to brian)  
Feature-team will be invistigating and will hand me over the new radar images to run it through pix2pix again.  


#### M. Measurable: 
Upon training, the new model training events (tensorboard) and test images will be given to eval team  
who'll compare it with last weeks.  
And this will be added to our list of attempts. The output should be present on the server  
under directory "run2"  


#### A. Achievable: 
Yes. It's not very different from the previous train/test/eval we did using pix2pix.  


#### R. Relevant :
This will uncover a serious problem we have with our current radar images.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
1 week once features team hands me the new radar images.  

### (you can add 2 more smart goals ... advisable)  


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)


Goal 1. Pix2pix on the server:
with Paul's help, we have CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 6.1 running on the server.  
Artifacts: emails and the fact that testtf.py on the server runs and passes the test.  


Goal 2. Bands 2,4,6 as RGB channels:
I ran pix2pix using multiple channels in a single image.    
Turns out it could only use up to 3 (RGB).  
The input/output directory is called "run1" and is present on the server   
as well as in [this google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ro-gzywrvPfQRpjvBNXLEUUDwLvd5Em5)   
[Code to do construct the multi-channel images](https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/sam/extarctImgs_MultiChannel.ipynb)
  
   
Goal 3. Failed to be done on time. (or rather not yet finished)  
This was supposed to be a done in cooperation with the rest of the team to find a baseline for evaluation.  
We got busy discussing other project matters (mostly what pix2pix input/output are like and what tensorboard is)   
and some weren't present.
