# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 11/15/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have craete the linear regression model inputting 1 pixel at a time now to use a a baseline


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Get the coeffiecients for my Linear regression and see which input is affecting the linear regression the most

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have a chart showing the importance of the coefficients

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of getting everything back since we have done this kind of work last semester

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project since it will create a baseline for our project


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Actually plot the confusion matrix and have a good representation that doesn't confuse those looking at it

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output confusion matrices

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since already started the code for it and just need to display it better


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because people will have to look at the evaluations in order to believe our work and the work needs to be clear


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Continue the comparisons between my results with the results from samis implementation and make it clear


#### M. Measurable: 
Will have the output images of the evaluation and comparisons in the powerpoints 

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since we have done it in the past and just need redo it for the new runs and compare

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it starts to compare the different group models

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
All Goals were met this week since I checked and ran linear regression again and compared it with previous runs
Did linear Regression with Sat Band 2, Sat Band 6, Mod Visibility Feature, Mod Relative Humidity Feature, Mod Specific Humidity Feature, Mod Temperature at the surface Feature.
Compared the new results from Sami with the old run (Both Pytorch)
Compared the confusion matrix of new results with old result
