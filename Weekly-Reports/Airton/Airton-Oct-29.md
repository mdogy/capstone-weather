# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 10/29/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have craete the linear regression model inputting 1 pixel at a time now to use a a baseline


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Start writting the code for linear regression 1 pixel at a time and get a run

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have a notebook with the code for it 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of getting everything back since we have done this kind of work last semester

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project since it will create a baseline for our project


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
After getting a succesful run for linear regresion I will evaluated it with SSIM and MSE

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output evaluation of the run

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since already have tensorboard working and now just have to do the same with pytorch


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it creates the necessary baseline for our project


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Start looking into confusion matrix and will add it as a part of the evaluation and do it successfully


#### M. Measurable: 
Will have the notebook with the code for it and hopefully the images of the evaluation

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since we have done it in the past and just need to do it for our project

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it adds and extra way of evaluating our project

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Mostly goal 3 was met and used most of my time for it.
Did MSE and SSIM of the new pytorch data and compared it to the old runs
New run is more accurate the MSE is lower than the previous ones
SSIM is mostly close to the 1 which is when the images are the same 
Attempted to create the confusion matrix on the new pytorch data ran into problem have questions to clarify
Did some confusion matrix examples to get more knowledge on it
Work is on https://github.com/yuanzhou15/capstone-weather/blob/master/Airton/Evaluation/PytorchEval.ipynb
