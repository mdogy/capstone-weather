# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have craete the linear regression model inputting 1 pixel at a time now to use a a baseline


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
New individual runs have been made. Need to get all of them from the machine at ccny

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have to evaluate so if I dont get them cant evaluate

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the skills to do this since its retriving new runs

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since I need them for evaluation purposes


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Need to evaluate each new run with confusion matrix SSIM MSE

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output evaluations for each new run and the jupyter notebook

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since I have been doing the work for different runs just need to adjust for new ones


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because its evaluating new models and giving us more comparison material


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Have a clear understanding of the new evaluated results since need the overall comparison 


#### M. Measurable: 
Will potentially have a markdown file for it and the comparison in the powerpoints

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since its understanding the work from the previous two goals

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives a better understanding of the linputs

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
All Goals were met this week since I was able to create a line graph showing the correctness of pix2pix vs linear regression at different thresholds. In addition got the images of linear regression and showed them with different thresholds to visually see the change.
