## Week 9 SMART Goals

Last week, re running vid2vid with the out of date gcc version still gave out the error, so this week's goals are related to getting vid2vid to run on google colaboratory. 

### SMART Goal 1
##### With CUDA installed on Google Colab, I am ready to set up vid2vid. But, first I want to resarch how I can get my jupyter notebook to run on data, and also how i can edit files for vid2vid, because before running some scripts, I ran into some bugs that I have to fix. This is an important step, because I dont have a file editor and so editing in a jupyter notebook will be different but essential. 

### SMART Goal 2
##### The next smart goal would be to push up data that I recieved from Rex up to my drive, and sync up my drive account to google colab so that I can just copy over the data from my drive to my colab enviroment. This is important because I need to have our data ready to train for vid2vid. This goal can be measured by the jupyter notebook that I push up to the repo with all the setup and syncing of my google drive account. 

### SMART Goal 3
##### The last goal of the week would be to set up vid2vid on google colab, and run a sample training script on the street dataset that vid2vid provides, because this can confirm that google colab is a good enviroment to set up vid2vid, and that it will be able to run with our datset. This goal can also be measured by having code on the jupyter notebook that I will push to the repo with all the set up process and training process.

### Stretch goal
##### The stretch goal would be to run vid2vid on our own data, so that we can compare results to pix2pix, and see if it's worth to invest more computing power on vid2vid. This will help our project, because vid2vid has a video discriminator which ensures the optical flow of the output data. This should be done before the end of the semester so we can conclude that vid2vid works with our data and if it's worth an investment.
