# Stretch Goal#1
After meeting with Brian and Prof. Grossberg, it was found that there is a fundamental error in my Inputs. I did investigation of the whole pipeline from the inputs to the visualization of the generated images and found that some that Rex gave me are Y-axis inverted. This led to re-training, re-testing, re-Visualizing of everymodel I had evaluated for the last month with NPY all over again. 


### Smart Goal #1:
Work with Yuan for Vid2Vid. Performed Vid2Vid Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Statistics like SSIM and RMSE

### Smart Goal #2:
Work with Sami for his final version ("runaug1") of Pix2Pix. Performed Vid2Vid Evaluation using Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Statistics like SSIM and RMSE


### Smart Goal #3:
Review Airton's and My Linear Regression code


# Achieved Goals:

## Goal #1:
Performed successful investigation and was able to diagnose the problem
