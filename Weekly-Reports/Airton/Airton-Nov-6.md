# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado
**Date:** 11/6/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have craete the linear regression model inputting 1 pixel at a time now to use a a baseline


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Double check work on my linear regression code have to make sure it correct

#### M. Measurable: 
Will have a notebook with the code for it and the updates that I make

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of getting everything back since we have done this kind of work last semester

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project since it will create a baseline for our project


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
After choosing a good threshold for the images I will run the confusion matrix code for the past runs

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I will have the output evaluation of the runs

#### A. Achievable: 
It is achievable since already started the code for it and just need to choose a threshold


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it creates the necessary baseline for our project


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Compare my results with the results from samis implementation


#### M. Measurable: 
Will have the output images of the evaluation and comparisons in the powerpoints 

#### A. Achievable: 
Its achievabe since we have done it in the past and just need redo it for the new runs and compare

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it starts to compare the different group models

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
Goals 1 and 2 were met and goal 3 is work in progress with some questions
Linear Regression- attempted to do linear regression with the 6 images input
Mean square error=1756.01
Pytorch mean square error= 538.89
Threshold for  Confusion Matrix- Looked into the pixels of radar image to choose a threshold in order to compute confusion matrix (next slide)
