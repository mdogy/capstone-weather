## Week 5 SMART Goals

### SMART Goal 1
##### The first smart goal of the week would be to have CUDA 9 installed on to the computers, since pix2pix is utilizing CUDA 8, but due to error's I've encountered trying to set up vid2vid and the issues page, it seems that CUDA 9 is more compatible with vid2vid.

### SMART Goal 2
##### The next smart goal of the week would be to have virtual environment set up for vid2vid with CUDA 9, so that anything I do for vid2vid won’t affect pix2pix. I can also have my own environment variables and no worry about interfering with Sami’s pix2pix. This goal can be measured by having a vid2vid environment on the node.  

### SMART Goal 3
##### The second smart goal would be to clear out data on the nodes since there is not enough space on disk to download the sample data. This goal can be measured by having a clean disk that only had code and no data that can be transfered out. Cleaning out the disk will allow me to run vid2vid with sample data to make sure that I have correctly set up the enviorment. This can be done before next week.

### SMART Goal 4
##### The third smart goal would be to be able to run training on the sample data of vid2vid. This will help ensure that I am able to run our own data on the GPUs. This can be measured by having the sample data on the machines, and a trained model that I can test on. This goal can be done within the next week.

### Stretch goal
##### The stretch goal would be to run vid2vid on our own data, so that we can compare results to pix2pix, and see if it's worth to invest more computing power on vid2vid. This will help our project, because vid2vid has a video discriminator which ensures the optical flow of the output data. This should be done before the end of the semester so we can conclude that vid2vid works with our data and if it's worth an investment.
