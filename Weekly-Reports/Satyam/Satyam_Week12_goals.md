# Stretch Goal #1:
There may be another bug besides the fliped images which has been apprent in Linear Regression results.
Diagnosing the issue has become a priority now


### Smart Goal #1:
#### S. Smart
Perform investigation and detect and diagnose the problem with Linear Regression

#### M. Measurable
This will result in a jupyter notebook meanr for bebugging the problem

#### A. Achievable
It has to be achieveable. I need to graduate

#### R. Relevant
The problem has to be found for successful baseline benchmarks

#### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week.



### Smart Goal #2:
#### S. Smart
Prepare for the final deliverables, review and re-run the notebook with feedback recievd from Brian and Prof. Grossberg


#### M. Measurable
The were notebooks created for
Linear Regression: 1x1 window Satellite and Model in NPY
Linear Regression: 3x3 window Satellite and Model in NPY
Linear Regression: 5x5 window Satellite and Model in NPY

Random Forest Regression: 1x1 window Satellite and Model in NPY
Random Forest Regression: 3x3 window Satellite and Model in NPY
Random Forest Regression: 5x5 window Satellite and Model in NPY

#### A. Achievable
Yes, it is achievable

#### R. Relevant
It is part of the effort for preparing for the delivearbles

#### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week.


### Smart Goal #3:
#### S. Smart
Add ROC Curve to the evaluations

#### M. Measurable
It will result in notebooks with ROC for nowonwrds

#### A. Achievable
Yes, it is achievable

#### R. Relevant
It is part of the effort for preparing for the delivearbles

#### T. Time-bound:
Yes, the goal is achievable and feasible for completing it in 1 week.
