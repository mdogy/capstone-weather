# Stretch Goal 1
The optimizing functions of the Generator and Discriminator used in pix2pix are still an enigma. Therefore, to fully exploit pix2pix for the precipitation prediction purposes it will be beneficial for the team to better understand how the Generator and Discriminator in terms of math

# Stretch Goal 2
During testing and training tensorflow models, I realized that my computer was taking unusually long time considering that it already has a powerful GPU. Upon investigation, it was found that though tensorflow is installed, but inorder to reach to its near-maximum potential GPU version of tensorflow is a required.



# Smart Goal 1:
S.Specific
Research theoratical and statistical aspects of Generator and Discrimator agents pertaining to pix2pix.

M. Measurable
Outline slides in the weekly meetings on loss functions and their corresponding tensorflow code in the pix2pix with jaw dropping and outstanding visuals 

A. Achievable
I have been delving into pix2pix a lot by this time. So, I am familiar with the basics, but the time has come to shower the wonders of pix2pix to my languid team members. It is truly achievable.

R. Relevent
To fully exploit pix2pix for the precipitation prediction purposes as it will be highly beneficial for the team to better understand how the Generator and Discriminator actually work behind the scenes

T. Time-bound:
The deadline for this task is anticipated to be 10/8/2018. This task should be completed witih in 1 week.


## Smart Goal #2:
S.Specific
Install Tensorflow of the GPU variant on the computer.

M. Measurable
Faster perfomance will be the measurement. As a proof, I will have screenshot of the terminal showcasing that tensorflow-GPU is installed and is running successfully

A. Achievable
Installing and setting up environments are not easy, especially, when working with video card drivers, but it should be achievable.

R. Relevent
run1 is the first generated prediction of radar data from pix2pix. In the past, Error matrics were only performed between two images. Line chart will allow comaprison and perfomances of metrices in realtion to different weather states of the region of interest

T. Time-bound:
The deadline for this task is anticipated to be 10/8/2018. This task should be completed witih in 1 week.



## Smart Goal #3:
Research theoratical and statistical aspects of autoencoder pertaining to pix2pix.

S.Specific
Due to Pix2Pix's generators resemblance with autoencorder, I will research on autoencoder and decoder

M. Measurable
I will have a tensorflow code in juputer notebook for autoencoder decoding showing the autocoding processes in action. I will present in the meeting and interpret the results in terms of my cutom input.

A. Achievable
This is a doable task. I can refer to Siraj raval videos

R. Relevent
In order to justify if the pix2pix is worth using, we should try modelling the ML algorithm using its constituents to find if the algoritm in fact runs as good as without using the whole package.

T. Time-bound:
The deadline for this task is anticipated to be 10/8/2018. This task should be completed witih in 1 week.
