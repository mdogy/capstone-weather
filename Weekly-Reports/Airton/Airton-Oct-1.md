# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Airton Prado

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. The stretch goal is to have the overall understanding in how the algorithm is working because every smart goal basically goes into a small part of the whole algorithm. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Look at the loss function of pix2pix and get a deeper understanding of it by looking at the tensorboard diagram of the overall algorithm and code.

#### M. Measurable: 
Create a notebook that shows how the function is working and possibly get it showing on the tensorboard. 

#### A. Achievable: 
I have the basic skills of running the program but need more which can be obtained with more exposure . The motivation is that this continues my growing knowledge of the algorithm to see whats happening. 

#### R. Relevant :
Its relevant since it ties with the overall project/ algorithm that sami is working with which uses tensorfow and the tensorboard.


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific:  
Download pytorch implements and test an output since Sami is moving to using pytorch instead of tensorboard from now on.
#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because can get the pictures that pytorch outputs and can write a markdon file about the two different implementations 

#### A. Achievable: 
 It is achievable since already have tensorboard working and now just have to do the same with pytorch


#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it gives me more insight of how the tensorboard works which I will be using a lot.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Organize the github repo and add information that has not been added yet.

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measureable because the repo will have in it all the new info that I add.

#### A. Achievable: 
I do have the skills for this goal.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because it organizes the work we are doing and maintains the repo in good shape for when people look at it. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Due next week


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

Goal 1 achieved Now that the tensorboard is working I was able to generate the graphs of the pix2pix.
Goal 2 was achieved since I started to look more in depth  of the correlation  of the tensorboard graphs with the code 
Became a goal 3 since my computer lost all data and I had to fix errors in my computer configs for the future work and had to reinstall programs
